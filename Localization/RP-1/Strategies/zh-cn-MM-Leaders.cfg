Takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the USAAF placed an order for experimental production versions.

He was criticized for letting his rivalry with Vladamir Chelomey get in the way of his work and his design approach was blamed for the failure of the N1. Still, it was well-deserved when he was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest award for cultural and industrial accomplishments in the Soviet Union. Considering they sent him to the Gulag in 1938 on false charges, this was the least they could do.

When looking into high-altitude flight, he calculated that the speed required to produce enough lift for a airplane to stay aloft would be the same as orbital speed at 82 kilometers altitude. This was then rounded to 100 kilometers and is why the Karman line is considered the boundary of space.

Their first design was tested on August 16, 1941, consisting of a small solid-fuel motor attached to the bottom of a plane. Takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the USAAF placed an order for experimental production versions. They saw a lot of success in the early days of spaceflight, but, like many U.S. rocket companies, they downsized during during the late 80s and early 90s.
