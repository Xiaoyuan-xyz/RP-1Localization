For your first mission, you should launch your first vessel. Just design and build a vessel, roll it out to the pad (or the runway if it's an airplane), throttle up with "Z" and stage to take off! (And note all the records to break in the 'Active Contracts' tab. They update, so keep checking.) If you haven't already, look at the tutorial on the GitHub wiki for advice on this and other missions.

It's the traditional dividing line between the atmosphere and space (despite there being nonzero pressure well above it; Earth's atmosphere extends quite far indeed). We want you to send something above it!

        #RP1CONTRACT_LOC__SuborbitalReturn_description = <b>Program: Early Rocket Development<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>As early as 1947 the U.S. was launching fruit flies into space on suborbital trajectories and recovering them, but it wasn't until 1951 that a monkey named Yorick and eleven mice were successfully recovered from an Aerobee flight. The Soviets preferred dogs and returned many from suborbital flights, the first two being Dezik and Tsygan in 1951 on top of an R-1. Although it is not a requirement to launch a biological capsule for this mission, it is a perfect opportunity to do so. Send a rocket out of the atmosphere (140 km) and return at least some of the craft back to Earth, intact, for study.
