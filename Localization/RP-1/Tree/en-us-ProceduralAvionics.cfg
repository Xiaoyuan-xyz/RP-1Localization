        #RP1TREE_LOC__proceduralAvionics_description = This is a procedural avionics unit.  It can be customized for your specific needs. It contains an avionics control unit and a short range antenna.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__ModuleProceduralAvionics_info1Text = Procedural avionics represents the hardware responsible for setting the spacecraft position, velocity and attitude, as well as controlling experiments, staging and action groups. If you select Near-Earth or Deep Space, it can directly control the craft, allowing it to change attitude and execute maneuvers.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__ModuleProceduralAvionics_info3Text = Choose the right shape and desired diameter(s) in the Part Action Window (main part PAW), and then fill in the fields below to determine the correct length (volume) of your procedural avionics part.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__Near-Earth_description = This part provides full control of the craft, instead of the limited control from Science core. The mass and volume of avionics necessary depend on tech level and the mass of the whole craft. It is functional only when close to Earth (up to 2x GEO distance). Uses: LV ascent guidance and upper stages that operate around the Earth.

Compared to to Near-Earth avionics, this works and offers control at any distance from Earth, and can be put on hibernation mode to save power. Uses: lunar and interplanetary probes, satellite buses when hibernation is desired.

Much lighter and lower power than an avionics-capable part of the same tech level. Fixed mass, cost and power consumption for each tech level. Uses: Unguided sounding rockets, Spin-stabilized kick stages, and Unguided probes
