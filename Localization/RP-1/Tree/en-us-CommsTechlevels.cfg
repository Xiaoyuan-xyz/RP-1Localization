        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL1_title = Comms Tech Level 1
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL1_description = Although still using analog transmitters, improvements in miniaturization allow for practical communication out to the moon. Idle power: 0.3 watts. (TL0 consumes 2 watts at idle.) NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL2_title = Comms Tech Level 2
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL2_description = Switching to digital encoding allows for a nearly 16 times increase in bandwidth, and much better sensitivity and lower noise allows for better range. However, the digital encoding equipment is much more power hungry than the simple analog equipment. Idle power: 8 watts. From this tech level on, your vehicles can function as relays. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL3_title = Comms Tech Level 3
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL3_description = Further reductions in noise and improvements in encoding and miniaturization improves performance, allowing for practical communication throughout the inner solar system. However, this results in even more power hungry digital equipment, further increasing idle power draw. Idle power: 19.5 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL4_title = Comms Tech Level 4
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL4_description = Better encoding methods allow for a massive 64 times increase in bandwidth, and other minor improvements increase range. Idle power: 25.7 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL5_title = Comms Tech Level 5
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL5_description = More general improvements allow for a slight increase in bandwidth and a slight decrease in power consumption. Idle power: 23 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL6_title = Comms Tech Level 6
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL6_description = Encoding improvements and noise reduction allow for a slight increase in bandwidth, and increase effective range enough for practical communications to the outer solar system. Idle power: 21.4 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL7_title = Comms Tech Level 7
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL7_description = Further general improvements to amplifiers and encoding. Idle power: 18.3 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL8_title = Comms Tech Level 8
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL8_description = More general improvements. Idle power: 18.3 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL9_title = Comms Tech Level 9
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL9_description = More general improvements. Idle power: 11.7 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL10_title = Comms Tech Level 10
        #RP1TREE_LOC__commsTL10_description = More general improvements. Arraying of 32-meter antennas improves Ka-band performance. Idle power: 9.5 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.
